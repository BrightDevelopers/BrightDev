# Contributing to BrightDev

Thanks for helping make BrightSign development easier for everyone! 🎉

## How to Contribute

### Quick Start
1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Create a branch** for your changes (`git checkout -b improve-hello-example`)
3. **Make your changes** (see guidelines below)
4. **Push** to your fork and **open a Pull Request**
5. Explain what your PR does and why it's valuable

If there's already an issue that describes what you're doing, feel free to reference it instead of re-explaining.

### What We're Looking For

All contributions are welcome:
- 🐛 **Bug fixes** - Broken examples, incorrect docs, dead links
- 📚 **Documentation improvements** - Clearer explanations, better examples
- ✨ **New examples** - Show us how you're using BrightSign!
- 🔧 **Enhancements** - Better templates, improved tooling, SDK additions

### Writing Good Code & Examples

**Make it clear, not clever:**
- Use descriptive names that reveal intent (`fetchPlayerStatus` not `fps`)
- Keep functions small and focused on one thing
- Write comments that explain *why*, not *what* (the code shows what)
- Avoid duplication—extract shared logic into reusable functions
- If you need to explain something complex, the code might need simplifying first

**For examples specifically:**
- Test it! Make sure your code actually runs
- Include error handling for the happy path at minimum
- Add comments for BrightSign-specific concepts newcomers might not know
- Keep examples focused—demonstrate one concept well rather than everything poorly

**For documentation:**
- Be concise but complete
- Verify all technical details are accurate
- Test all commands and code snippets
- Check that links work

### Code Review

The core team will review your PR. We might suggest changes to improve clarity or consistency. This is normal—we're all here to make BrightDev better together.
